Description of the task

Part 1:Command Line Parsing (Xinxin)
Same:
- The command line arguments parsing logic is almost the same with Assignment 8 where is loops
  through the passed-in arguments, performs validation, and saves the data locally. The saved data
  is used later on by the DigitalEntryManager to perform the related operations.
Difference:
- It extracts out all the data we need to the ParsedArgs class instead of leaves them as fields of
  the CommandLineProcessor class. And we applied the Singleton design pattern to the CommandLineProcessor
  so that the whole project would only have a single CommandLineProcessor instance.

Part 2: ProcessFile.ReadJournalData (Fan)
Same: read csv file as the same as Assignment8
Difference: For entry "priority", if it offered with "?", read it as "3"
            For entry "category", if it offered with "?", read it as "null"


Part 3: DigitalEntry (Fan)
Task 1: Build Immutable fields, with exceptions
test - required field
completed - optional, default is false, can be set to be true
date - required
priority - optional, should in between 1 to 3. If no priority specific, I recommend set it as "?"
           then deal with it on read part.
Category - optional. If not specific, I recommend set it as "?", then deal with it on read part.


Task 2: Set up the ID for user. (Belongs to Yan's function. Can be discussed)


Part 3: Function implementation (Yan)
Interface: addNewDigitalEntry()
           completeExistEntry()
           displayEntries()
